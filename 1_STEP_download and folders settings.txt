We suppose that you will have a specific working directory, and you will put all the project files on the same folder
 that we will name "./" throughout this guide.
An asterisk "*" is placed in front of procedures that you have to do.

I) Folder creation:
* Create the following folders in the working directory "./":
    1- data
    2- extracted features
    3- features
    4- figures

./ (working directory)
├── all code (*.py)
|
├── extracted features
├── features
├── figures
└── data
    ├── columnLabels.csv
    ├── demographic.csv
    ├── ERPdata.csv
    ├── mergedTrialData.csv
    ├── time.csv
    |
    ├── 1.csv
    |   └── 1.csv
    ├── 2.csv
    |   └── 2.csv
    |            .
    |            .
    |            .
    └── 81.csv
        └── 81.csv




II) Download:
* Download the data that is present in: 
	1- first part: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/broach/button-tone-sz
	2- second part: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/broach/buttontonesz2

* Once the data are downloaded they should be extracted and placed in a sub-folder named <data> on your working directory.
    /!\ the folders names should be respected as they are case sensitive.


III) Requirements and install:
	numpy==1.23.3
	scikit-learn==1.1.2
	mne==1.1.1
	termcolor==2.0.1
	matplotlib==3.6.0
	seaborn==0.12.1
	scipy==1.9.1
	pandas==1.5.0
	tqdm==4.64.1
	tabulate==0.9.0
	PyQt5==5.15.9


Once these steps are completed, you can procede on running 1_Step ... until the end.
